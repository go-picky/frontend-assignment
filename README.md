# Image Management & Compression Mini-App

## Overview

Your task is to create a simple image management application using **Next.js**. This application will allow users to upload an image, preview it, and receive a compressed version. The focus of this assignment is to assess your ability to leverage Next.js for both front-end and API functionality while adhering to the constraints laid out below. The implementation details—including design, architecture, and choice of libraries—are left up to you.

## Constraints & Requirements

### 1. API Constraints

**API Routes:**

- Use Next.js API routes to handle backend functionality.

**Image Handling:**

- Provide an endpoint that accepts an image file upload.
- Include an endpoint to compress an image and return the resulting file.

**Data Management:**

- You may use any local database (e.g., SQLite, in-memory database, or even a JSON file) to store metadata or manage records.

**Containerization or Easy Startup:**

- Ensure the application is containerized or can be easily started using simple commands.

### 2. Front-End Constraints

**User Interface:**

- Build a responsive UI using **Next.js** that allows users to:
  - Select and preview an image file locally.
  - Upload the image to your API.
  - View both the original and compressed versions.

**Design Freedom:**

- The UI design, component organization, and additional features are entirely up to you.

### 3. General Constraints

**Project Organization:**

- Organize your project with clear separation of concerns (e.g., API routes, UI components, utilities, etc.).

**Error Handling & Validation:**

- Implement basic error handling and input validation to maintain a smooth user experience.

**AI/LLM Tool Usage:**

- You may use modern AI tooling to assist in the assignment, but please provide documentation of your usage and be prepared to discuss it.

**Documentation:**

Include a README that details:

- Setup and installation instructions.
- Architectural decisions and reasoning.
- Instructions to run and test the application.
- Any assumptions or limitations.
- Any explanations, descriptions or relevant chat logs to help understand how you used AI.

### Bonus (Optional)

**Enhanced Containerization:**

- Provide a Dockerfile for containerizing your application.

## Notes

- The primary purpose of this assignment is to assess your technical skills and design choices.
- You have the freedom to choose your tools and approach, as long as the constraints above are met.
- Keep the scope manageable to ensure that the application can be built and demonstrated in a short time frame.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your solution!
